TODO:
Short-Term: (Before 1.13/1.14 Port Completion)
- Variable Model: (To Big to Complete..! before port): Get basics working
- To Fix for Models:
    - CuboidBase: VariableLight
- BakedModel's
- Add a debug / log when GroovyLoader is not setup but is used.

- Can't initModel with Renderer: MachineProperties setRenderer: doesn't work with current Buildcraft approach to setting the Renderer or Vice-Versa

- Can't Read model .json even if correct path for model location. May need to externalize / split the reading and defining the path from class constructor
	- Can read if using ResourceLoaderContext
		- New issues with GroovyObjectPart and setting Textures and ModelParts by name

- Voltage for Tiers. More fluent approach
	- Seperate from MJ and FE
	- Integrated into Energies approach doesn't allow easy conversion between Energies

Long-Term:
- GroovyMC Model inter compatible with Forge's IModel API
- GroovyMC Model inter compatible with Vanilla ModelBase
- MultiBlocks
- GuiBuilder
- Improve Modules

Insight to Own Model Issues:
Buildcraft:
- FunctionContext
- ResourceLoaderContext
- ModelHolderVariable: Does not initialize JsonVariableModel
- ModelHolderStatic: Does not initialize JsonModel
