# GroovyMC
A Minecraft Mod Library created using the Apache Groovy programming language.

A mod library used in my other mods both existing and upcoming.

The library is useful for any mod developer wishing to utilize features within Apache Groovy without having to start their own mod from scratch.

## Getting Started

Please initialize the "GroovyLoader" in your main class or common proxy class.
The class is not required, but provides a lot of built in functions and functions that have been auto-completed when used, making life that little bit easier.
Example:
GroovyLoader groovyLoader = new GroovyLoader(String modPath, String modResourcePath, String jvm, String url, String modID);
or look at GroovyMC.groovy for a completed example.
Note: the source for this class is under utils
